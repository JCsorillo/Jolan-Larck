                <p><i>November 4, 2024</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Good day, esteemed guests, dedicated faculty, staff, and beloved students.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, as we gather under the theme “NISU: Creating Safe Space and Good Health for Everyone,” we are reminded of our collective responsibility to foster an environment that not only respects but celebrates the diverse identities, expressions, and orientations of each individual. Our program this year centers on “A Gender-Inclusive Engagement Among People of Diverse SOGIESC,” which emphasizes the importance of understanding and embracing the unique experiences of everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Creating an inclusive and safe space is more than just a moral obligation; it is a foundation for building a university community where everyone can thrive in a culture of respect, dignity, and kindness. When we empower each individual to express themselves freely and feel valued for who they are, we strengthen the bonds that hold us together and foster a supportive environment that enhances well-being and mental health for all.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As President of NISU, I am deeply committed to ensuring that our campus is a beacon of inclusivity and acceptance. Together, let us break down barriers, encourage open dialogue, and nurture an environment where diversity is celebrated, and everyone feels they belong. Let us continue to champion each other's rights and work towards a future where our university truly reflects the values of compassion, equality, and respect.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        May this program inspire each of us to play an active role in this mission and to recognize the impact we can have in creating a community where every voice is heard, respected, and valued.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you, and may our journey towards a more inclusive NISU flourish.

                <h3>Message for the Research In-House Review <br>
                    Theme: "Pushing the Frontiers of Research Across Higher Education Disciplines Towards National Development"</h3>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    <b>October 17, 2024, VSC.</b> Distinguished faculty, researchers, and guests, good morning and welcome to our Research In-House Review! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is an honor to be with you all as we gather to celebrate the passion, creativity, and dedication that fuel the research community of Northern Iloilo State University. This year’s theme, <i>"Pushing the Frontiers of Research Across Higher Education Disciplines Towards National Development,"</i> encapsulates our collective goal of advancing knowledge for the benefit of our institution, our community, and the nation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Research is more than just the pursuit of knowledge—it is the engine that drives transformation. At NISU, we view research as a bridge that connects academic disciplines to real-world solutions. Every study conducted and every innovation developed contributes to the progress of our society. The knowledge we generate shapes policies, improves livelihoods, enhances education, and promotes sustainability.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our university exists not just to nurture minds but also to address the pressing needs of the communities around us. Through research, we explore solutions for agricultural challenges, develop technologies for local industries, and find new ways to enrich education and public service. Research creates a ripple effect—when we solve a problem in our community, we lay the groundwork for larger national impact.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Research also plays a significant role in faculty development and career advancement. It is through rigorous study and innovation that educators grow professionally. We are proud that many of our faculty members have achieved career milestones by publishing in reputable journals, presenting at international conferences, and receiving patents and copyrights. The Research In-House Review is one way we ensure that our faculty have the platform to present their work, engage with peers, and elevate their careers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Allow me to share a story that reflects the power of research in shaping academic journeys. One of our own researchers at NISU started as an instructor with a passion for solving real-world problems through innovation. Through years of hard work, he pursued impactful research projects—one of which led to a patented predictive charging mechanism and another that involved groundbreaking image processing technology for fish freshness detection. His research not only earned recognition from national and international bodies but also directly benefited the fishing communities in Iloilo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because of his persistent dedication to research, he gained the credentials needed for career progression. Over time, he was able to publish over 200 research papers, become a respected figure in his field, and secure local and international grants. This journey culminated in his promotion to Full Professor—a testimony that when we commit to research excellence, the path towards career fulfillment and academic success unfolds naturally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today, as we review the projects you have tirelessly worked on, I encourage each of you to see beyond the confines of data and analysis. Your research carries the potential to uplift lives, transform systems, and push the frontiers of what is possible. This event is not just about sharing results—it is about inspiring others, learning from peers, and building collaborations that will strengthen our collective impact.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I commend every researcher who has contributed to making this review a success. Let us continue to harness the power of research to enrich our university, empower our faculty, and serve our communities. Together, we can advance towards national development, guided by the discoveries we unveil and the innovations we create.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you, and may this event spark new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities for all.
                    <br>
